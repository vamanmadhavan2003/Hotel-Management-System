# Hotel-Management-System

The project, Hotel Management System is a command line based application that allows the hotel manager to handle all the hotel activities and helps in managing various hotel bookings and rooms, making this system more flexible and convenient.

This system provides room booking as itâ€™s main feature. This system allows the manager to post available rooms in the system. Customers can view and book based on the data submitted in the program. The system is hence useful for both customers and managers to manage booking aspects of the hotel more effectively.
